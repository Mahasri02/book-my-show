    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the CineVerse application's core features, focusing on user authentication, movie listings, seat selection, and real-time updates. The structure prioritizes authorization independence and simplifies security rules. User data is stored under `/users/{userId}`. This path-based ownership is simple and secure. Since this application does not need collaborative documents a more complex membership model is not required. Movie listing details and showtimes will need careful consideration for caching. To optimize listing and searching, consider denormalizing key properties into a dedicated `/movies` collection. This duplication, while increasing storage, will drastically improve query performance and reduce read costs. Seat selection could also be cached aggressively, but real-time updates are critical. Therefore, use websockets that trigger cloud functions to update Firestore on seat reservations. This ensures data consistency while providing near real-time updates to users."
